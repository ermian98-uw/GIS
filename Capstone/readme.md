Repository for my MGST Capstone Project code. This code was used to automate capture of weather stations, weather station data, ECOSTRESS data, and various arcpy geoprocesses (e.g., spatial autocorrelation).

Note: ECOSTRESS_swath2grid.py is NOT my code, it is only very slightly modified to fit my workspace.
